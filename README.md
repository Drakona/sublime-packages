# sublime-packages
A shared repository with our Sublime Text 3 packages and configuration.
We use it on Ubuntu 14.10.

## How to use this config

* Make sure Package Control is installed (if not, [follow those steps on packagecontrol.io](https://packagecontrol.io/installation))
* Close Sublime Text
* move all files from ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/User to somewhere safe (make sure your directory is empty)
* Clone into  ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/User 
* start Sublime Text 3
* Now, we have the exact same config ;) .
